    "\n",
    "In this first homework, we'll introduce some basic operations of working with static word embeddings (calculating the cosine similarity between two vectors, and finding the nearest neighbors in vector space among a set of embeddings), and then use those basic operations to learn something interesting about the datasets those vectors were estimated from: measuring the orientation of words along different semantic axes (e.g., the degree to which a word like \"doctor\" is associated with men or women in the underlying dataset); and measuring the *change* in meaning of a word across domains, including time (e.g., \"cabinet\", \"awesome\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, feel free to use [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) for vector operations, but **do not import any other libraries** outside of those already provided (e.g., do not import pandas).  Many of the homeworks that we'll have later in this course will use vector and matrix operations in libraries like pytorch that are very similar to numpy, so it's worth getting some exposure to numpy now.\n",

    "Word embeddings are the foundation of many of the NLP models we'll use in this class, and provide a representation of input words for a range of different tasks.  But we can also interrogate the representations themselves to examine a number of different questions.  First, let's consider the question of how to measure the orientation of word representations along specific semantic axes: e.g., for an axis defined by the endpoints \"happy\" and \"sad\", where do word embeddings estimated from a specific dataset situate a word like \"smile\"?  As we've seen in class, this gives us a mechanism for interrogating bias: if we define an axis by the endpoints \"man\" and \"woman\", for example, where do we see words like \"doctor\" and \"nurse\" appearing along this spectrum? (For similar word in this vein, see [Bolukbasi et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf), [Blodgett et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.485.pdf).)\n",

Given a set of word embeddings for one category $S^+ = \\{v_1^+, \\ldots v_n^+\\}$ and embeddings for a contrasting category $S^- = \\{v_1^-, \\ldots v_n^-\\}$ that both define the endpoints of the axis, SemAxis outputs a single real-value score for an input word $w$ with word representation $v_w$:\n",

    "Lots of work in NLP has used word embeddings to examine how word meanings have changed over time (e.g., [Hamilton et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02821.pdf), [Garg et al. 2018](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3635.short), [Kulkarni et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.3315.pdf)).  We can examine this here by looking at word embeddings trained on datasets written at different times: GloVe vectors trained on contemporary text (including Wikipedia and the general web), and vectors trained on literary texts from Project Gutenberg (mainly written before 1925).  We can't directly compare two vectors estimated in separate training procedures (since the embedding spaces are not equivalent), but we can compare the overlap in their nearest neighbors to get a sense of the degree of their change across these different domains.\n",
